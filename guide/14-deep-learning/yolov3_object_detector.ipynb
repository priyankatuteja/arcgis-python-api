Its advantage has been in providing real-time detections while approaching the accuracy of state-of-the-art object detection models.\n", "\n", "In the earlier works for object detection, models used to either use a sliding window technique or region proposal network. Sliding window, as the name suggests choses a Region of Interest (RoI) by sliding a window across the image and then performs classification in the chosen RoI to detect an object. Region proposal networks work in two steps - first, they extract region proposals and then using CNN features, classify the proposed regions. Sliding window method is not very precise and accurate, and though some of the region-based networks can be highly accurate they tend to be slower.\n", "\n", "Then came along the one-shot object detectors such as [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325), [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) and [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002). These models detect objects in a single pass of the image and, thus, are considerably faster, and can match up the accuracy of region-based detectors. The [SSD guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-ssd-works/) explains the essential components of a one-shot object detection model. You can also read up the RetinaNet guide [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/). These models are already a part of ArcGIS API for Python and the addition of [**YOLOv3**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767) provides another tool in our deep learning toolbox.\n", "\n", "The biggest advantage of YOLOv3 in `arcgis.learn` is that it comes preloaded with weights pretrained on the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/). This makes it ready-to-use for the 80 common objects (car, truck, person, etc.) that are part of the COCO dataset."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/yolov3_demo.gif\"/></center>\n", "<center>Figure 1.

As the name suggests, this backbone architecture has 53 convolutional layers. Adapting the ResNet style residual layers has improved its accuracy while maintaining the speed advantage.

It uses upsampling and concatenation of feature layers with earlier feature layers which preserve fine-grained features. Another improvement is using three scales for detection. This has made the model good at detecting objects of varying scales in an image. There are other improvements in anchor box selections, loss function, etc. For a detailed analysis of the YOLOv3 architecture, please refer to this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-53fb7d3bfe6b)."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<center><img src=\"../../static/img/yolov3.jpg\"/></center>\n", "<center>Figure 2.
